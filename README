Attoconf is A small and sensible replacement for GNU autoconf.

Principles:
* Assume most build environments are sane, and ignore the rest.
* Never automatically toggle features based on the build environment.
* Written in python2 for easy editing and wide portability.
* GPL, but this does not apply to the program being built.
